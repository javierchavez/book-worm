  Making a Library application

** Technology 
   How can we use available technologies, or develop a new one. We
   need to interface with what is already available.

*** Think about cost
    - implement something new
    - implement something new on top of what is already there
*** Complexity:
    - Employees have to learn a new system.
   
*** Posibilities
    - barcodes 
    - rfid 
    - nfc

*** Software
    - Reccomendation engine
    - Search engine

*** DB (mueen)
    - what are some imidiate hardships to think about
    maybe even bottlenecks.
    - how to get it into the DB
    - redunancy? DB type NoSQL SQL
    - set up columns (for generic)
    
*** Speed ()

*** Algorithms (sean?)
